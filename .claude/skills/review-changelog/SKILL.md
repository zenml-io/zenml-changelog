# Review Changelog Entries

This skill helps complete new changelog entries after our automated release workflow creates a PR. The automation generates entries with placeholder values that need human review and completion.

## Context

- **Preview URL**: https://zenml-announcements-preview.vercel.app/ - Paste the final JSON here to preview how it will look
- **Schema docs**: See `changelog_schema/README.md` for field documentation
- **S3 images**: Feature images are uploaded to `public-flavor-logos` S3 bucket in `whats_new/` folder

## Required Fields (never remove)
- `id` - unique sequential number
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `title` - headline
- `description` - detailed description
- `published_at` - ISO 8601 datetime with Z suffix

## Optional Fields (remove if not provided)
- `feature_image_url` - screenshot/image URL (S3 bucket)
- `video_url` - YouTube embed URL
- `learn_more_url` - blog post or additional info URL
- `docs_url` - ZenML documentation URL
- `published` - boolean (default: true, can usually leave out)
- `highlight_until` - datetime to stop highlighting
- `should_highlight` - boolean, makes announcement pop up for users
- `audience` - "oss", "pro", or "all" (default: "all")
- `labels` - array of: "feature", "improvement", "bugfix", "deprecation"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify New Entries

Run these commands to find the current branch and new entries:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git diff main -- changelog.json
```

Parse the diff to identify entries that were added (look for lines starting with `+`). New entries typically have:
- Empty strings for `feature_image_url` and `video_url`
- Placeholder URLs like "https://example.com/REPLACE-ME" or "https://docs.zenml.io/REPLACE-ME"

### Step 2: Review Each Entry

For each new entry, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather information. **IMPORTANT**: Always check recent entries (last ~5) in `changelog.json` for overlapping content before proceeding.

#### 2.0 Should Include (Ask First)

Before asking about details, first ask whether this entry should be included at all:

- **Yes, include this** - Proceed with remaining questions
- **No, duplicate of recent entry** - Remove this entry entirely (content already covered in a recent changelog entry)
- **No, not significant enough** - Remove this entry entirely (too minor for the changelog)
- **Merge with another entry** - Combine with another new entry in this PR

When asking this question, **provide context** by:
1. Showing the entry title and a brief summary
2. Listing any recent entries (last ~5) that might overlap
3. Noting any obvious duplications

If the user chooses to remove or merge, skip all remaining questions for this entry and handle the deletion/merge accordingly.

#### 2.0.1 Update Entry Content (if keeping)

If the user chooses to include the entry but mentions it needs updating (e.g., wrong focus, inaccurate description, or should be based on a specific PR), ask:

- **Keep current title/description** - The generated content is accurate
- **Update based on specific PR** - User provides a PR URL with better context (fetch and read it)
- **Manual update** - User will provide new title/description text

When updating based on a PR:
1. Fetch the PR description using `gh pr view <number> --repo <repo> --json title,body`
2. Extract the key user-facing changes
3. Rewrite the entry title and description to accurately reflect the PR's changes
4. Show the proposed update to the user for approval before applying

#### 2.1 Audience
- **oss** - Only open-source users see this
- **pro** - Only ZenML Pro users see this
- **all** - Everyone sees this (default)

#### 2.2 Labels
Verify the labels are correct. Options:
- `feature` - New functionality
- `improvement` - Enhancement to existing functionality
- `bugfix` - Bug fix
- `deprecation` - Deprecated features

#### 2.3 Feature Image
Ask if there's a feature image/screenshot. Options:
- **No image** - This field will be removed from the entry
- **Already uploaded** - User provides existing S3 URL
- **Local file** - User has a local image that needs processing (see [Processing Local Images](#processing-local-images))

Images are hosted at: `https://public-flavor-logos.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/whats_new/`

#### 2.4 Video URL
Ask if there's a video demonstration. If yes, get the YouTube embed URL.
- Format: `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
- If no video, this field will be removed from the entry

#### 2.5 Learn More URL
Ask if there's a blog post or article. If yes, get the URL.
- Usually a zenml.io/blog post
- If no blog post, this field will be removed from the entry

#### 2.6 Docs URL
Ask if there's relevant documentation. If yes, get the URL.
- Usually https://docs.zenml.io/...
- If no docs URL, this field will be removed from the entry

#### 2.7 Should Highlight
Ask if this announcement should be highlighted (pops up for users).
- Default: false
- Set to true for major features

### Step 3: Update changelog.json

Use the Edit tool to update each entry:
1. Update `audience` if different from default
2. Update or verify `labels`
3. Either set valid URLs or remove placeholder fields entirely
4. Set `should_highlight` if true

**Important**: Remove optional fields with empty/placeholder values rather than leaving them. A cleaner entry looks like:

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "slug": "enhanced-pipeline-scheduling",
  "title": "Enhanced Pipeline Scheduling",
  "description": "You can now pause and resume schedules...",
  "published_at": "2026-01-14T09:20:00Z",
  "published": true,
  "audience": "all",
  "labels": ["improvement"],
  "docs_url": "https://docs.zenml.io/concepts/schedules"
}
```

### Step 4: Prompt Preview

After updating all entries, tell the user:

> **Next Steps:**
> 1. Copy the updated `changelog.json` content
> 2. Go to https://zenml-announcements-preview.vercel.app/
> 3. Paste the JSON to preview how your entries will appear
> 4. If everything looks good, commit and push the changes

## Example AskUserQuestion Flow

For entry "Enhanced Stack Management with Update Functionality":

```
Questions to ask (can batch related questions):

0. Should we include this entry?
   Context: "Enhanced Stack Management with Update Functionality" - Allows updating stacks from the UI.
   Recent entries that might overlap:
   - ID 10: "Enhanced Pipeline Scheduling and Stack Management" - Already mentions stack update page

   Options:
   - Yes, include this (Recommended if it adds significant new detail)
   - No, duplicate of recent entry (content already in ID 10)
   - No, not significant enough
   - Merge with another entry in this PR

[If user chooses "Yes, include this", continue with remaining questions...]

1. Audience: Is this feature available to...
   - OSS users only
   - Pro users only
   - All users (Recommended)

2. Labels: The current labels are ["feature"]. Is this correct?
   - Yes, keep as feature
   - Change to improvement
   - Change to bugfix
   - Other (specify)

3. Do you have a feature image URL for this entry?
   - No image
   - Yes (will prompt for URL)

4. Do you have a video URL?
   - No video
   - Yes (will prompt for URL)

5. Do you have a blog post URL (learn more)?
   - No blog post
   - Yes (will prompt for URL)

6. Do you have a docs URL?
   - No documentation link
   - Yes (will prompt for URL)

7. Should this entry be highlighted (pop up for users)?
   - No (default)
   - Yes, highlight this
```

## Processing Local Images

When a user has a local image file that needs to be used as a feature image:

### Step 1: Get the Local File Path

Ask the user for the full path to their local image file (PNG, JPG, etc.).

### Step 2: Convert to AVIF

Use the `avif-image-compressor` skill to convert and compress the image:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/avif-image-compressor/scripts/convert_to_avif.sh "/path/to/image.png" --quality 30 --output "/tmp/output-name.avif"
```

- Quality 30 provides good visual fidelity for UI screenshots
- Typical compression: 80-90% size reduction

> **Note**: The AVIF compressor skill is available in the private `zenml-io/skills` repository. Team members who don't have it installed can clone it from there.

### Step 3: Upload to S3

Upload the converted image to the `public-flavor-logos` S3 bucket:

```bash
aws s3 cp /tmp/output-name.avif s3://public-flavor-logos/whats_new/output-name.avif --profile default
```

- Try the `default` AWS profile first
- If that fails, try the `zenml` profile
- All PR reviewers on this repo should have permissions to upload

### Step 4: Get the Final URL

The final URL will be:
```
https://public-flavor-logos.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/whats_new/output-name.avif
```

Use this URL for the `feature_image_url` field in the changelog entry.

### Naming Convention

Use descriptive, kebab-case names for images:
- ✅ `enhanced-logs.avif`
- ✅ `pipeline-scheduling-ui.avif`
- ❌ `screenshot1.avif`
- ❌ `image.avif`

## Tips

- Batch questions where possible to reduce back-and-forth
- For entries with no supplementary content (no images, videos, blog, docs), just clean up the entry by removing placeholder fields
- The `published: true` field can usually be left in or removed (defaults to true)
- Make sure URLs are valid - schema validation will fail otherwise
